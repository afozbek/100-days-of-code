### R2D1

Hello again with the new round of the #100DaysOfCode. Today I tried to update my code setup on bitbucket. I created header of the web page and I applied ABEM structure to our web application.

### R2D2

Today I investigated mega menus & I looked at some base projects' code and tried to understand it.

### R2D3

Today I learned the differences between inline & inline-block element.

### R2D4

Today I looked at the mobile-first approach and tried to implement project's header using this approach. We will be using this approach when developing our application.

### R2D5

Today I learned about css margin collapsing problem and how can we solve it.
