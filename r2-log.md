### R2D1

Hello again with the new round of the #100DaysOfCode. Today I tried to update my code setup on bitbucket. I created header of the web page and I applied ABEM structure to our web application.

### R2D2

Today I investigated mega menus & I looked at some base projects' code and tried to understand it.

### R2D3

Today I learned the differences between inline & inline-block element.
